A news aggregator that uses the Alchemy API to analyze and compare the bias of news stories. 

Why it was never completed:

Due to unforeseen limitations in editing a full parse database, it was not possible to assign bias to articles using cloud computing, and having each device query Alchemy individually to assign bias was not an acceptable alternative. If the app were to be completed, a service such as the Google Cloud Platform would be implemented instead of Parse for the additional computational power and scalability.

The Alchemy API was also unable to judge the sentiment of some articles accurately in machine vs. human testing, so in order for the app to fulfill its stated goal a different form of bias analysis would have to be implemented. 

In the end, we still had a functioning news aggregator, but the bias analysis was unfortunately unable to be implemented during MHacks II.
